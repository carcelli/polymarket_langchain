    "# Polymarket Agents Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the interactive documentation for the Polymarket LangChain project. This set of notebooks will guide you through the core components of the system, from API interaction to autonomous agent workflows.\n",

    "   - Discover how to build more reliable agents by managing Runtime, State, and Store context sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",    "\n",
    "Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root directory with at least the following:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key\n",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key\n",
    "POLYGON_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key # Optional: for trading\n",
    "```\n",
